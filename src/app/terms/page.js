            Welcome to Sozodigicare! These Terms of Service ("Terms") are a legal agreement between you (the "User") and Sozodigicare Limited ("Sozodigicare," "we," "our," or "us"). Sozodigicare Limited provides an online telemedicine platform operating in the Republic of Ireland. By registering for or using our online medical consultation services (the "Services"), you agree to these Terms. You also agree to our Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, and Refund Policy, which are each incorporated into these Terms by reference. Please read all of these documents carefully. If you do not agree with any of these Terms or policies, do not use our Services.
          </p>

          <p>
            Throughout this document, when we refer to the "Platform," we mean the Sozodigicare website and application through which we offer telemedicine services. A "Practitioner" refers to an independent medical doctor who is registered with the Irish Medical Council and provides remote consultations via Sozodigicare. The term "Consultation" means a telemedicine appointment you have with a Practitioner through our Platform (for example, a video call or phone call). "You" or the "User" means the person who registers an account or uses our Services, including a parent/guardian who registers on behalf of a minor.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[var(--color-primary-6)] mt-8">1. Eligibility to Use the Service</h2>
          <p>To use Sozodigicare's Services, you must meet all of the following conditions:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
            <li><strong>Age Requirement:</strong> You must be at least 18 years old. If you are under 18, you may only use the Services with the involvement and consent of a parent or legal guardian. The parent/guardian must agree to these Terms on your behalf.</li>
            <li><strong>Minors Under 16:</strong> If you are under 16 years old, your parent or guardian must provide verifiable consent for you to use the Services and will likely be asked to supervise your use. (This is to comply with data protection law regarding minors.)</li>
            <li><strong>Location:</strong> The Services are intended for use within the Republic of Ireland. You must be physically located in Ireland during any medical Consultation. This is because our Practitioners are licensed in Ireland and can only practice within that jurisdiction.</li>
            <li><strong>Personal Use Only:</strong> You may only use the Services for your own personal healthcare or for a dependent for whom you are the parent or legal guardian. You cannot use the service for any third party who is not under your legal care.</li>
            <li><strong>Accurate Information:</strong> You must provide true, accurate, and complete information about yourself (or your dependent) when registering and during consultations. This includes your name, contact details, medical history, and any other information requested.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>By registering an account, you confirm that you meet the above eligibility criteria. You also agree that we may ask for proof of things like age or guardian consent if necessary, and you will provide such proof if requested.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[var(--color-primary-6)] mt-8">2. Account Registration and Security</h2>
          <p>When you create an account, you will need to provide a valid email, set a password, and possibly other authentication details. You are responsible for keeping your login credentials confidential. Do not share your account or password with anyone else. If you believe someone else has gained access to your account, notify us immediately at contact@Sozodigicare.ie so we can help secure it.</p>
          <p>You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account. If you let someone else use your account (which we don't recommend), you will be responsible for anything that person does. We reserve the right to suspend or close accounts that we suspect are being used fraudulently or in violation of these Terms.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[var(--color-primary-6)] mt-8">3. Scope of Services We Provide</h2>
          <p>Sozodigicare offers a platform that connects Users in Ireland with qualified medical Practitioners for remote healthcare services. Here's what we provide:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
            <li><strong>Remote Consultations:</strong> You can have a video or phone consultation with an Irish Medical Council (IMC) registered doctor through our Platform. These Practitioners can provide medical advice, diagnosis, and treatment recommendations based on what can be done safely via telemedicine.</li>
            <li><strong>Prescriptions:</strong> Practitioners can issue private prescriptions for medications when appropriate. These prescriptions will be issued to the desired pharmacy in Ireland directly via email. Please note: We do not prescribe any controlled substances or high-risk medications through Sozodigicare (for example, we will not prescribe narcotics or sedatives that are controlled by law). Such medications require in-person evaluation.</li>
            <li><strong>Medical Certificates & Letters:</strong> If appropriate, a Practitioner may issue medical certificates (such as sick notes for work or school) or referral letters (for specialist visits or tests). However, we do not issue Social Welfare illness benefit certificates (the certs required for government social welfare claims) through this service. For those, you will need to see a GP in person.</li>
            <li><strong>Referrals:</strong> Practitioners can provide referral letters to specialists or recommendations to attend further services (like blood tests, X-rays, etc.) as needed.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[var(--color-primary-6)] mt-8">4. Our Role (Platform Provider) vs. Practitioner's Role (Medical Care)</h2>
          <p>It is important to understand that Sozodigicare Limited is a technology platform provider, not a medical clinic. We facilitate your interaction with independent medical professionals, but we do not practice medicine ourselves.</p>
          <p>Our Platform services as a telemedicine provider, we secure video consultation system, electronic health record (EHR) storage, scheduling tools, and patient communication functions used on our website and app. Sozodigicare is bound by strict contractual obligations under GDPR, including the use of encryption, access controls, and certified data centres.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[var(--color-primary-6)] mt-8">5. Consent to Telemedicine</h2>
          <p>By using Sozodigicare's Services, you give your consent to receive healthcare via telemedicine. This means you understand and agree to the following:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
            <li><strong>Remote Nature of Care:</strong> The consultation with the Practitioner will be conducted remotely (via internet video or phone). No physical examination can be performed.</li>
            <li><strong>Reliance on Information Provided:</strong> Because the doctor cannot examine you physically, the accuracy and usefulness of the medical advice depend on you giving thorough and truthful information.</li>
            <li><strong>Technical Limitations:</strong> You understand that there can be technical problems with telemedicine. Connections might drop, video/audio could be unclear, or there could be interruptions.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[var(--color-primary-6)] mt-8">6. User Responsibilities and Acceptable Use</h2>
          <p>When you use Sozodigicare, you agree to conduct yourself responsibly and lawfully. Here are your responsibilities as a user of our Services:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
            <li><strong>Provide Accurate Information:</strong> You must provide truthful, accurate, and complete information at all times.</li>
            <li><strong>Follow Medical Advice:</strong> If a Practitioner provides you with a treatment plan, prescription, or advice, you agree to follow those instructions as given.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Medications Responsibly:</strong> Any prescription you receive via Sozodigicare is for your personal use only.</li>
            <li><strong>Respectful Conduct:</strong> You will treat all Sozodigicare staff and Practitioners with respect and courtesy.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[var(--color-primary-6)] mt-8">7. Payments, Fees, and Refund Policy</h2>
          <p>Using Sozodigicare's medical Services typically requires payment. Here's what you need to know about fees and refunds:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
            <li><strong>Service Fees:</strong> The price for consultations or any other paid Services will be clearly indicated on our Platform.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment Methods:</strong> We accept major credit/debit cards and/or other payment methods as listed on our Platform.</li>
            <li><strong>Refund Policy:</strong> For details on refunds, please review our Refund Policy which is incorporated into these Terms.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[var(--color-primary-6)] mt-8">8. Privacy and Data Protection</h2>
          <p>Your privacy is extremely important to us. We handle your personal data in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Irish data protection laws. Here is a summary of how we manage your data:</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[var(--color-primary-6)] mt-8">10. Limitations of Liability</h2>
          <p>This section is important – it outlines the limits of what Sozodigicare (the company) is responsible for legally. While we stand behind our Platform, there are certain risks or outcomes for which we cannot accept liability, to the extent permitted by law.</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
